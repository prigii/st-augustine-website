          The Sacred Heart Devotion is a response to the
          awareness of Jesus’ infinite Love for mankind, the
          majority of whom constantly reject Him by
          persistence in their sinful ways or who respond to
          His Love with indifference and even outrages.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Devotion is hence a call to make reparation to
          Jesus’ wounded Heart thus granting It consolation.
          This is done particularly on the first friday of the
          month. Our Parish provides us an
          opportunity for Adoration, Confession and Mass in
          Reparation to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.
