          The Legion of Mary is a Catholic lay movement that
          was founded in November 1936 by Edel Quinn in
          Africa. The movement emphasizes devotion to the
          Blessed Virgin Mary and is dedicated to performing
          acts of charity, prayer, and spiritual growth.

          In Juja, the Legion of Mary began in 2016. The main
          activities of the Legion of Mary include praying the
          rosary, reciting the Catena, reading the Legion
          handbook, and engaging in charitable work
          Currently, there are 10 active members who
          participate in all activities.

        <p className="mb-4">
          The group welcomes more members to join them, so they can continue
          their charitable works, prayer, and living out the
          Legionary spirit as exemplified by Edel Quinn.
