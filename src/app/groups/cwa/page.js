        <p className="mb-4">
          Catholic Women Association is a lay movement which brings Catholic
          Women closer to God and unites them as they participate in the
          general development of themselves, church and community.
        
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The main aim of this movement is to enhance the spiritual growth of the catholic
          woman and enable them to participate effectively in evangelization
          and sanctification under the patronage of St. Monicah. Any catholic
          girl, lady or woman above 18 years is welcome to join and grow strong
          in faith.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The CWA members of St Augustine parish and JKUAT chaplaincy have
          been able to actively participate in various activities including charity
          where we visit the sick in homes and hospitals providing to the needy
          and giving services where needed. As CWA, we evangelize in the family
          and community at large, sharing of the Word in our prayer meetings as
          well as participating in church development.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          CWA has 355 registered members in our parish spread in the five
          outstations. By the Grace of God we are growing steadily with
          membership increasing year by year. We are truly thankful to God for
          the good things He has continued doing for the women.
