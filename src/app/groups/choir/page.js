        <p className="mb-4">
          Members of these choirs meet weekly for music rehearsals in order to
          prepare relevant songs for liturgical celebrations. The total number
          of choir members in our Parish currently stands at about 200 members
          and the numbers are still growing. This is evidenced by the
          commissioning of new choir members on 8th June 2024 where a total of
          27 new choir members were commissioned.

          Nairobi (ADN) need to undergo formation followed by commissioning.
          Choir members from St Augustine Catholic Parish are involved in
          charitable works, retreats, recording of new liturgical music,
          attending music training workshops/ seminars and participating in the
          St. Cecilia Day Mass celebrations in November of every year for all
          choir members in the Archdiocese of Nairobi.

          St. Cecilia is the patron saint of music and musicians. Notably, Kwaya
          ya Mtakatifu Romano Mtunzi, which comprises of catholic community
          students from JKUAT, is actively involved in recording of liturgical
          music. This vibrant choir is a great blessing to our Parish.
