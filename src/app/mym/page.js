        <p className="mb-4">
          We are dedicated to ministering to youths between
          the ages of 14 years to 18 years, most of whom are
          in high school. We endeavor to foster a spirit of
          mission and service among young people through
          our charism, "Fishers of men".
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We engage the youth in activities that promote spiritual growth,
          community involvement and global awareness of
          the Catholic Church's mission. Members of MYM
          participate in various initiatives during school
          holidays such as educational programs, sports, debates, missionary
          outreach, volunteer projects, and cultural exchanges.
          MYM currently has a membership of 245 and 7
          animators.
