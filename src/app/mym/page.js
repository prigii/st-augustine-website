        <p className="mb-4">
          We are dedicated to ministering to youths between
          the ages of 14 years to 18 years, most of whom are
          in high school. We endeavor to foster a spirit of
          mission and service among young people through
          our charism, &quot;Fishers of men&quot;.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We engage the youth in activities that promote spiritual growth,
          community involvement and global awareness of
          the Catholic Church&apos;s mission. Members of MYM
          participate in various initiatives during school
          holidays such as educational programs, sports, debates, missionary
          outreach, volunteer projects, and cultural exchanges.
          MYM currently has a membership of 245 and 7
          animators.
