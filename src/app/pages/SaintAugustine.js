            Saint Augustine of Hippo (13 November 354 â€“ 28 August 430) was a Roman African, early Christian theologian and philosopher from Numidia whose writings influenced the development of Western Christianity and Western philosophy. He was the bishop of Hippo Regius (present-day Annaba, Algeria) in North Africa and is viewed as one of the most important Church Fathers in Western Christianity for his writings in the Patristic Era.

          <p>
            Augustine was born in 354 in the municipium of Thagaste (now Souk Ahras, Algeria) in the Roman province of Numidia. His mother, Monica, was a devout Christian; his father, Patricius, was a Pagan who converted to Christianity on his deathbed. Augustine was educated in North Africa and later in Rome and Milan.

          />
          <p>
            Augustine's works, including "The City of God," "On Christian Doctrine," and "Confessions," continue to be influential. His thoughts profoundly influenced the medieval worldview and the Protestant Reformation. He is a saint in the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Anglican Communion.
