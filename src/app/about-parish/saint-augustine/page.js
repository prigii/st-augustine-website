              Saint Augustine of Hippo (13 November 354 â€“ 28 August 430) was a
              Roman African, early Christian theologian and philosopher from
              Numidia whose writings influenced the development of Western
              Christianity and Western philosophy. He was the bishop of Hippo
              Regius (present-day Annaba, Algeria) in North Africa and is viewed
              as one of the most important Church Fathers in Western
              Christianity for his writings in the Patristic Era.

              Augustine was born in 354 in the municipium of Thagaste (now Souk
              Ahras, Algeria) in the Roman province of Numidia. His mother,
              Monica, was a devout Christian; his father, Patricius, was a Pagan
              who converted to Christianity on his deathbed. Augustine was
              educated in North Africa and later in Rome and Milan.

              continue to be influential. His thoughts profoundly influenced the

              Anglican Communion.
