          St. Augustine Catholic Parish and University Chaplaincy, Juja, comprises
          of five main choirs:
        <ul className='font-semibold'>
          <li> St. Teresa of Kolkota Choir - 1st Mass</li>
          <li>Kwaya ya Mtakatifu Romano Mtunzi (KMRM) - 2nd Mass</li>
          <li>St. Monica Choir- 3rd Mass</li>
          <li>St. Paul Choir- Gachororo</li>
          <li>Mary Mother of God Choir- Mirimani</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Members of these choirs meet weekly for music rehearsals in order to
          prepare relevant songs for liturgical celebrations. The total number of
          choir members in our Parish currently stands at about 200 members
          and the numbers are still growing. This is evidenced by the
          commissioning of new choir members on 8th June 2024 where a total
          of 27 new choir members were commissioned.

          Parishioners wishing to join any catholic choir in the Archdiocese of
          Nairobi (ADN) need to undergo formation followed by commissioning.
          Choir members from St Augustine Catholic Parish are involved in
          charitable works, retreats, recording of new liturgical music, attending
          music training workshops/ seminars and participating in the St. Cecilia
          Day Mass celebrations in November of every year for all choir members
          in the Archdiocese of Nairobi.

          St. Cecilia is the patron saint of music and musicians.
          Notably, Kwaya ya Mtakatifu Romano Mtunzi, which
          comprises of catholic community students from JKUAT, is actively
          involved in recording of liturgical music. This vibrant choir is a great
          blessing to our Parish.
