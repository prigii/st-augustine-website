          The Youth Serving Christ (YSC) group is a vibrant
          community of young Catholics aged 18 to 26. With
          around 80 active members, the group is guided by a
          dedicated executive committee comprising the
          Chaplain, Patron, Matron, and YSC Executive members.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Our members are primarily university and college
          students, interns, and young professionals beginning
          their careers or businesses. Some have recently
          transitioned from the Missionary Youth Movement
          (MYM).
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The YSC is committed to nurturing young
          people into responsible adulthood through our guiding
          principles of the 5Fs: Fun, Family, Formation, Faith, and
          Follow-up. We warmly invite all young Catholics aged
          18 to 26 to join us in their respective outstations.
