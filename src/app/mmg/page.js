            Mary Mother of God was started as St. Maryâ€™s
            Mirimaini under St. Teresa Kalimoni Parish. Initially,
            the Church was hosted by Mirimaini Primary school
            where the mass was being celebrated in a
            classroom. The church had less than 100 Christians
            and two Small Christian Communities.

            The church has witnessed tremendous growth in

            Christians to expand the church twice. Plans to build
            a new church with a one thousand capacity are at an

          In the year 1994, the late Marysusan Njeri, a member
          donated a piece of land to build the Church. The late
          Fr. John Christopher Mohany, the then Fr. Incharge
          for St. Teresa Kalimoni oversaw the construction of
          the church and presided over its ceremonial
          opening in a Holy Mass on 23'rd July 1995.

          The outstation has very active ecclesial
          groups. Many Christians have received various
          Church Sacraments and in particular the outstation
          has produced the first Priest in the Parish, Fr.
          Joseph Kibe Kigara.
